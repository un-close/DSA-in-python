## Summary:
find the maximum score obtainable by the first player in a game where each player can take all the stones in the first x remaining piles where x is between 1 and 2m, m initially set to 1 and after each turn m is set to max(m, x)

# INTUITION:
- define a dp state where `dp[i][j]` where `i` is the index and `j` is the value of m.
- `dp[i][j]` represent the maximum score possible at `ith` index with value of m as `j`.
- We can recursively find for all states by the formula:
	- `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], suffix_sum[i] - dp[i+x][max(x, m)]`


# IMPLEMENTATION:
```python
    def stoneGameII(self, piles: List[int]) -> int:

        suffix_sum, dp = [0] * ((n:=len(piles)) + 1), [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n+1)]

        for i in range(n-1, -1 , -1):

            suffix_sum[i] = suffix_sum[i+1] + piles[i]

        for i in range(n, -1, -1):

            for m in range(1, n + 1):

                for x in range(1, min(2 * m, n - i) + 1):

                    dp[i][m] = max(dp[i][m], suffix_sum[i] - dp[i + x][max(x, m)])

        return dp[0][1]
