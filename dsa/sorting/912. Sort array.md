Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem **without using any built-in** functions in `O(nlog(n))` time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

# INTIUTION :
## Summary 
The question ask to sort the given array in ascending order with worst case tc of `O(nlog(n))`.
- the choose would be between quick sort and merge sort
#### Merge Sort:
- the array is divided into left and right part till they can't be divided
- then left and right part are joined in ascending order
- its built recursively after
#### Quick Sort:
- to do
