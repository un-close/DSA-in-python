# Bottom up dp:

Here we two words, word1 & word2 and we have to convert word1 into word2 using following 3 operations: 1) insert 2) delete 3) replace

- we have to try all the possibilities here and time constraints speaks for dp
- it will be a two state dp as the ans depends on the length of the 2 words
- `dp[i][j]` gives as the min operation possible to make the word1 have 'ith' length and word2 have 'jth' length.
- `dp[i][n]` should give the min operation to make word1 reach the end as word2 is already reached. This would be m - i
- when `word1[i] == word2[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j+1]`  

```py
   dp, m, n = [[0] * (len(word2)+1) for _ in range(len(word1)+1)], len(word1), len(word2)

        for i in range(m+1):dp[i][n] = m - i

        for j in range(n+1):dp[m][j] = n - j

        for i in reversed(range(m)):

            for j in reversed(range(n)):

                if word1[i] == word2[j]:

                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j+1]

                else:

                    dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1], dp[i+1][j+1])

        return dp[0][0]
```
