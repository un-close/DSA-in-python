## Summary:
given a graph and a query of form a, b such that we have to determine whether a comes before b in the topological sorting

# Intuition:
- do topological sort by Kahn's algorithm and track the pre-requisite courses through set
```python
class Solution:
    def checkIfPrerequisite(self, n: int, pr: List[List[int]], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[bool]:
        in_degree, pre_courses, graph = [0] * n, [set() for _ in range(n)], [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for a, b in pr:
            graph[a].append(b)
            in_degree[b] += 1
            pre_courses[b].add(a)
        bfs = [node for node in range(n) if not in_degree[node]]
        for node in bfs:
            for neig in graph[node]:
                in_degree[neig] -= 1
                pre_courses[neig] |= pre_courses[node]
                if not in_degree[neig]:bfs.append(neig)
        return [a in pre_courses[b] for a, b in queries] 
```

# Another approach:
- as we have to check whether a is pre-requisite of b, we could just find the all the nodes that can be reached by a and mark them true.
- A neat way to do the above is using floyd-warshall algorithm

```python
class Solution:
    def checkIfPrerequisite(self, n: int, pr: List[List[int]], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[bool]:
        graph, N = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)], range(n)
        for a, b in pr:graph[a][b] = True
        for k, i, j in product(N, N, N):
            graph[i][j] = graph[i][j] or (graph[i][k] and graph[k][j])
        return [graph[i][j] for i, j in queries]
```
