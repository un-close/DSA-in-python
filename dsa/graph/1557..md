Have to find the min set of vertices required to visit all the node of the graph. 
The given graph is an acyclic directed graph.
**Input:** n = 6, `edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]
**Output:** [0,3]
**Explanation:** It's not possible to reach all the nodes from a single vertex. From 0 we can reach [0,1,2,5]. From 3 we can reach [3,4,2,5]. So we output [0,3].`
# Intuition :
- the nodes with indegree 0 are the ones that must be included in the *set*. 
- As per the definition, all the other nodes will be connected with some other node
- reverse the connection and find the nodes maybe?
