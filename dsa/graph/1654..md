A certain bug's home is on the x-axis at position `x`. Help them get there from position `0`.
The bug jumps according to the following rules:
-   It can jump exactly `a` positions **forward** (to the right).
-   It can jump exactly `b` positions **backward** (to the left).
-   It cannot jump backward twice in a row.
-   It cannot jump to any `forbidden` positions.
The bug may jump forward **beyond** its home, but it **cannot jump** to positions numbered with **negative** integers.
Given an array of integers `forbidden`, where `forbidden[i]` means that the bug cannot jump to the position `forbidden[i]`, and integers `a`, `b`, and `x`, return _the minimum number of jumps needed for the bug to reach its home_. If there is no possible sequence of jumps that lands the bug on position `x`, return `-1.`
**Input:** forbidden = [14,4,18,1,15], a = 3, b = 15, x = 9
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 3 jumps forward (0 -> 3 -> 6 -> 9) will get the bug home.

**Input:** forbidden = [8,3,16,6,12,20], a = 15, b = 13, x = 11
**Output:** -1

### Summary:
- bug can jump from any point in +ve direction 
- bug can't jump backward twice neither can it jump to negative number side

# INTUITION:
- set some positive upper bound to stop checking
- **bfs** is a good tool for finding minimum distance
- queue modified for direction as well as visited

                    seen.add(forward)
                    dq.append(forward)
                if dir and pos - b > 0 and backward not in seen:
                    seen.add(backward)
                    dq.append(backward)    
            steps += 1         
        return -1
