## Summary:
The find the shortest path possible that can used to visit all the node given we can visit the nodes more than once.

# INTUITION:
- typical **bfs** question with part of visited state being the main catch
- Here as we can *visit the node more than once*, we have to come up with a way such that same path taken shouldn't be included into the bfs queue to avoid repetition.
- As the no of nodes are *less than 32*, we could use an integer (32 slots) to represent the current path being processed by including the no of nodes included(for 4 nodes, 1st node can be represented as 0001, 2nd as 0010, and so on...)
- The shortest path is reached when all the bit are *set* (if the no of nodes are 4, then 1111 shows all the nodes are visited) inside the visited state and it's guaranteed the shortest path as we are using bfs
- We need to track the node and paths in which it *was* part of, so if don't have to process the same node for the node have seen processed with *same path / visited state* beforehand

# IMPLEMENTATION:
```py
class Solution:

    def shortestPathLength(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> int:

        n = len(graph)

        set_bit = [(1 << i) for i in range(n)]  # for representing each no as bit

        complete_path = (1 << n) - 1  # represents that all the nodes have been visited

        path_status = [{set_bit[i]} for i in range(n)]  # the node and the path that was taken

        queue = [(node, set_bit[node], 0) for node in range(n)]  # node,current path status, total steps taken

  

        for node, path, distance in queue:

            for neighbour in graph[node]:

                curr_path = path | set_bit[neighbour]  # including the neighbouring node in the current path

                if curr_path == complete_path:

                    return distance + 1

                if curr_path not in path_status[neighbour]:  # checking whether the current node was processed before,with same path

                    path_status[neighbour].add(curr_path)

                    queue.append((neighbour, curr_path, distance + 1))

  

        return 0 # handling case in which graph is empty
