## Summary:
find the shortest distance to reach the last index from the 0th index from the following actions:
- i -1, i + 1, or to any index such that the value at the index is same as the value of the current index

# INTUITION:
- create a graph with each nodes neighbor's being one of the steps
- create a visited set 
- after including the a numbers neighbor's with the index for same value, its should be not be included in the list as it's already included

# IMPLEMENTATION:
```py
class Solution:

    def minJumps(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:

        q, seen, freq = [(0, 0)], {0}, defaultdict(list)

        _ = [freq[num].append(i) for i,num in enumerate(arr)]

        for node, dist in q:

            for neig in [node + 1, node - 1, *freq[arr[node]]]:

                if neig != node and 0 <= neig < len(arr) and neig not in seen:

                    if neig == len(arr) - 1:

                        return dist + 1

                    seen.add(neig)

                    q.append((neig, dist + 1))

            freq.pop(arr[node]) # 'important step for optimization'

        return 0
