## Summary:
detect the cycle and return the starting point if any.

# INTUITION:
- If *k* is the distance from the head of link list to the start of the cycle and let *x* be the distance from the start of the cycle to the point where the fast and slow pointers meet(Floyd's cycle detection is used here). 
- As we know the distance travelled by the fast pointer is 2 as that of slow pointer
- the distance covered by the slow pointer is : `k + x` and the distance covered by the fast pointer will be then `2(k + x)`
- let the length of the cycle be `L`. Then  the distance covered by the fast pointer is `k + x + nL`, where n shows the times of round it went around the cycle.
- so `2(k + x) = k + x + nL`, which in turn gives `nL - x = k`, where `nL - x` is the distance left for the fast/slow pointer to cover to reach the starting and `k` is the distance from head to starting of cycle.
- from the above, if we reset one of the pointer to head and start both pointers, we will get the starting of the cycle.

# IMPLEMENTATION:

```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.

# class ListNode:

#     def __init__(self, x):

#         self.val = x

#         self.next = None

  

class Solution:

    def detectCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        slow, fast = head, head

        while fast and fast.next:

            slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next.next

            if slow == fast:

                slow = head

                while slow != fast:

                    slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next

                return slow

        return None
