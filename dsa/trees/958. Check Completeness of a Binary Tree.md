## Summary:
the title

# INTUITION:
- can do bfs and check if there is a node which appear after the first null in which case the tree is not complete
- can also use the fact that a complete tree can be represented in an array with left child as $2*i+1$ and right child as $2*i+2$. Just doing bfs or dfs and checking this fact also work

# IMPLEMENTATION 1:

```python
class Solution:
    def isCompleteTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        bfs, i = [root], 0
        while bfs[i]:
            bfs.append(bfs[i].left)
            bfs.append(bfs[i].right)
            i += 1
        return not any(bfs[i:])
```

# IMPLEMENTATION 2:

```python
class Solution:
    def isCompleteTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        q = [(root, 0)]
        for node, i in q:
            if node:
                q.append((node.left, 2 * i + 1)), q.append((node.right, 2 * i + 2))
        return q[-1][-1] == len(q) - 1
```
